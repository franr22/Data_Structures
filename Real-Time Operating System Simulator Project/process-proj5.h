/* A Process object represents a batch-executed computer process, which has a
 * submission time and a hard real-time deadline before which it must finish.
 * It also has an amount of time that it requires to execute.
 *
 * A Process object has a (unique) id, which starts at 0 and should increment
 * whenever a new process is created. It is up to the operating system to assign
 * it an ID.
 *
 * Finally, a Process object has a data member "information", which is printed
 * when the run() method executes.
 *
 * The default constructor for the Process initializes all the data members to
 * reasonable defaults, and the id to the given ID (default is 0).
 *
 * The run method prints out the information contained in this process, and
 * then returns the system time plus the required time (which is the new system
 * time).
 *
 * The canComplete method returns true if the method would be able to complete
 * if it starts now, or false if it could not finish by its deadline.
 *
 * The getId method returns the id of this Process object.
 *
 * The operator< method is used to order Processes by:
 *  1. deadline (least to greatest)
 *  2. required time (least to greatest, if deadlines are equal)
 *  3. id (least to greatest, if deadlines & required times are equal)
 * The operator< method returns true if (*this) < p, false otherwise.
 *
 * The operator>> method is used to read in the submissionTime, deadline,
 * requiredTime, and information from an istream.
 *
 * The Process class does not allocate any of its own memory, so the
 * compiler-provided copy constructor, destructor, and operator= do not need to
 * be changed.
