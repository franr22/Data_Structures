/* The Graph class represents a set of vertices and directed, weighted edges
 * between those vertices. The cost of each edge is given by an integer value,
 * and the special value INFINITE_COST is a large number which represents an
 * impossible cost. We assume that no real path in the graph has a total cost of
 * INFINITE_COST or more.
 *
 * This Graph class uses an edge list format, meaning that there is a vector of
 * lists of Edge objects, and if an edge exists between two vertices, then it
 * will be listed in the inner list of the vertex the edge leaves from. If there
 * is NO connection from vertex A to vertex B, then this is represented by the
 * absence of an edge from A to B (and NOT by the inclusion of an edge of cost
 * INFINITE_COST). Remember that the adjacency list representation does not keep
 * track of non-existent edges.
 *
 * The constructor makes a graph with enough space for the given number of
 * vertices. No edges are present in the graph at this point.
 *
 * The addEdge method adds an edge connecting (from -> to) with the given cost.
 *
 * The dijkstra method is the classical Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm,
 * which starts at the given source vertex and finds the shortest paths to all
 * other vertices in the graph. The method will return a vector that lists the
 * shortest path cost of going from the source vertex to each vertex in the
 * graph. The cost of going from a vertex to itself is always 0. If a vertex is
 * not reachable, then the distance to it should be >= INFINITE_COST.
 *
 * The inVertexRange method checks that the given index is within the
 * appropriate range for accessing vertices.
 *
 * The adjacencyList data member is a sparse representation of the edges in the
 * graph. It is a vector of lists of Edge objects. If an edge exists between
 * vertex i to vertex j, then edgeList[i] will have an Edge object that points
 * to vertex j, with an associated cost. If there is no edge between them,
 * then edgeList[i] will not have an Edge object that points to j.
 *
 * The copy constructor and operator= methods are off limits for this data
 * structure.
