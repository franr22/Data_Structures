/* Class declaration for a simple stack of Location objects. It is not
 * a templated class; it can contain only Location objects. It can
 * grow and shrink because it is a linked structure. The class
 * LocationStackNode (below) encapsulates the nodes of the stack.
 *
 * Methods push(), pop(), and getTop() provide standard stack methods.
 * Using assert() to check for problems in these three methods could
 * be useful (hint).  isEmpty() returns true if the stack is empty,
 * false otherwise. isOn() returns true if the given Location is on
 * the stack, otherwise returns false.
 *
 * operator<<() streams out the stack from bottom to top. This method
 * should NOT make a copy of the stack. Instead, it should require two
 * passes over the stack to print the stack. The first pass will
 * traverse the stack to top->bottom, reversing the links of the nodes
 * as it goes. The second pass will traverse from bottom->top,
 * printing each Location as it is visited, and undoing the reversing
 * of the node links.
 *
 * The default constructor initializes the data members as
 * appropriate, and the destructor frees any allocated memory. The
 * copy constructor and operator= are not usable in this class;
 * therefore they are non-public and will fail on an assert() if called.
 *
 * The data member top is a pointer to the top node.
