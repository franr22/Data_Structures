/* Changes from project 1:
 *
 * Data member validLocations was changed from a Location array to a
 * set<Location>, but it still represents the group of locations that may be
 * visited in the maze.
 *
 * Data member validLocationCount was eliminated (because validLocations is no
 * longer an array).
 *
 * We let the compiler provide the operator=, copy constructor, and destructor
 * for this version of the Maze, since this Maze does not handle any memory
 * allocations itself.
